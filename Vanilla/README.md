## Good ol' neural networks

This folder contains the numpy implementation for good old multi-layer neural network.

Tasks :
- [x] Implement Feedforward
- [x] Implement Backpropagation
- [x] Implement Multilayer
- [x] Implement Training loop
- [ ] Implement the gradient check function
- [x] Make sure it actually trains lol (loss decrease)

Todo :
- [ ] Create a layer-based architecture where each layer is its own object
- [ ] Implement other kinds of loss functions
- [ ] Decouple backprop logic from the currently used activation function to allow other activation functions (sigmoid sucks)
- [ ] A lot of refactoring
- [ ] Create some kind of debug mode so i dont have to comment out print statements everytime something went wrong lmao
