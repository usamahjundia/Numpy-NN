## Recurrent networks

This folder contains the numpy implementations of the recurrent variants of neural networks. So far, only the vanilla RNN has been succesfully implemented.

Tasks:
- [x] Implement feedforward calculation
- [x] Implement backpropagation (this one took the longest)
- [ ] (optional) Implement a simple gradient checking function
- [x] Implement a simple training algo (sgd)
- [x] Make sure the training actually decreases the loss
- [ ] Implement generating prediction given a seed
- [ ] Generalize for many to one, one to one, one to many, and many to many tasks
